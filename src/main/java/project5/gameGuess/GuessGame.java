        When the guess number is less than the secretNumber then print "Your number is small. Try a bigger number.".
        When the guess number is more than the secretNumber then print "Your number is big. Try a smaller number.".
        When the guess number is equal to the secretNumber than print "You won. Congrats!". And stop execution.

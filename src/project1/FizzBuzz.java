        Write a program

            -that prints "fizzbuzz" when given number is divisible by both 3 and 5
            -that prints same number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5

        Examples:
            input1 -> 10 | output1 -> fizz
            input2 -> 9  | output2 -> buzz
            input3 -> 30 | output3 -> fizzbuzz
